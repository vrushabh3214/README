## 💡 Project Concept (Project Idea)

**Foodie** is a modern, web-based food delivery platform designed to bridge the gap between the restaurant and its customers. The primary goal of this project is to provide a seamless, digital ordering experience where customers can browse menus, manage their cart, and place orders directly from their devices without any hassle.

Unlike traditional ordering methods, Foodie offers a **visual-first interface**, making food discovery engaging and the checkout process effortless. It is built to be fast, responsive, and user-friendly.

## 🔄 User Workflow (How it Works)

The application follows a logical flow to ensure the user completes their order with minimum clicks.



### 1. Discovery (Home & Menu)
The user lands on the website and sees featured items and categories. They can filter food items (e.g., Pizza, Burger, Salad) to find exactly what they crave.

### 2. Selection (Add to Cart)
Users can view detailed information about the food item (Price, Rating) and add it to their cart with a single click. The cart updates instantly.

### 3. Authentication (Secure Login)
To place an order, the user logs in or signs up. This ensures we capture their delivery details correctly and save their history for future convenience.

### 4. Checkout & Order Placement
The user reviews their cart summary and confirms the order. The system then processes the request and confirms the delivery status.
